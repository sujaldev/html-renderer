# HTML Renderer

A tiny package written in python to render html documents. Does not support (and
probably never will) a majority of features found in a modern web browser.
Primarily the goal is to implement enough to be able to render Markdown
documents. Speed isn't the top most priority with this project, but there are
plans to switch to cpython once it works fairly well.
